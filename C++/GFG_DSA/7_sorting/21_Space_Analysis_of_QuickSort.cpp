// Is QuickSort stable?
// The default implementation is not stable. However any sorting algorithm
// can be made stable by considering indexes as comparison parameter.

//  as an in-place sorting algorithm as it uses extra space only for
//  storing recursive function calls but not for manipulating the input.
